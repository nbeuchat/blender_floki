# Blender Udemy course - characters
This repo contains the models and renders I built with Blender 2.9 for the ["Complete Blender Creator: Learn 3D Modelling for Beginners"](https://www.udemy.com/course/blendertutorial/) course on Udemy. 

It contains the following models:

- A funky caterpillar quickly modelled to test Metaballs and sculpting tools
- The head of Floki from the Vikings TV show
